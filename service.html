                <td>Our primary goal at Paws & Claws Haven is to provide animal rescue services.<br>
                     Our mission is to rescue animals from mistreatment, exploitation, and euthanasia. <br>
                     In response to emergency calls, our rescue crew works nonstop, offering prompt medical attention as well as secure transportation to our facilities.<br>
                      After coming into our care, these animals get the food, medical care, and emotional support they require to recover. <br>
                      Giving every rescued animal a second opportunity at a life free from pain and fear is our mission.</td>

                     We meticulously evaluate every animal's requirements, disposition, and well-being to guarantee the most optimal fit with prospective adopters. <br>
                     We offer direction and assistance to new pet owners to ensure a seamless transition into their duties through our comprehensive adoption procedure.<br>
                     Adopting an animal not only results in a devoted friend, but it also has a significant positive influence by giving the animal a fresh start.</td>

                     Our veterinarian team is prepared to manage all facets of animal health, from basic examinations and immunisations to urgent care and surgery. <br>
                     Every animal in our care receives the necessary medical treatment from us to keep them happy, healthy, and prepared for adoption. <br>

                     Additionally, we collaborate with neighbourhood groups to support immunisation campaigns, spay and neuter programs, and ethical pet ownership.<br>
                     Our goal is to make the community more involved in order to make the environment safer and more compassionate for all animals.
